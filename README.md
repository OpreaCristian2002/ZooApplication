# ZooApplication
Simple project so that I understand basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming in Java.

When starting the application it asks(in the terminal) for a file where there are stored shelters for animals and for a file where there are stored animals. It reads those files and it stores them in a container called AnimalCatalog. Then it gives the user the possibility of perfroming different actions and get certain results.
